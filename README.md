# Association for Computing Machinery Portal

![TrackIT Automated Testing and Continuous Integration](https://github.com/acmutd/portal/workflows/ACM%20Portal%20Automated%20Testing%20and%20Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

Official front-end for the _ACM_ website & portal.

### Quick Start

 - Create `.env` file for Auth0 configuration, request ACM Development for domain and client ID. 
 - Run `npm start`

### Extended Start Guide

###### Mobile vs Web Development

`App.tsx` splits what gets rendered into two separate views through `react-device-react`. Content stored in `/src/mobileviews` should contain views for smaller viewports wheras content in `/src/views` should contain full screen views. In situations where it is not necessary to create two separate views, save it in `/src/views` and duplicate the content in `App.tsx` so that it gets rendered in all situations. 

###### Auth0 & Authentication

Refer to [ACM Development Authentication](https://github.com/acmutd/Auth-flow-template) for more information on using our authentication features. 

###### Connecting to backend

In progress
All communication with firebase should occur through the ACM Portal API. Refer to [ACM Portal Backend](https://github.com/acmutd/portal-backend) for more information on locally testing the backend.
